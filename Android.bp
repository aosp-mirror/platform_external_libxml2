// To update:
//

//  git merge aosp/upstream-master
//  mma -j
//  # (Make any necessary Android.bp changes and test the new libxml2.)
//  git push aosp HEAD:master  # Push directly, avoiding gerrit.
//  git push aosp HEAD:refs/for/master  # Push to gerrit.
//
//  # Now commit any necessary Android.bp changes like normal:
//  repo start post-sync .
//  git commit -a
//

// This comes from the automake-generated Makefile.
// We deliberately exclude nanoftp.c and nanohttp.c, the trio library, and zlib.

// Added automatically by a large-scale-change that took the approach of
// 'apply every license found to every target'. While this makes sure we respect

//
// e.g. GPL in an MIT project might only apply to the contrib/ directory.
//
// Please consider splitting the single license below into multiple licenses,
// taking care not to lose any license_kind information, and overriding the
// default license using the 'licenses: [...]' property on targets as needed.
//
// For unused files, consider creating a 'fileGroup' with "//visibility:private"
// to attach the license to, and including a comment whether the files may be
// used in the current project.
